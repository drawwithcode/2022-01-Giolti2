# Luigi Veronesi - Costruzione 
This repository is the starting point of the assignments given in the elective course [Creative Coding at Politecnico di Milano](https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?&evn_default=evento&c_classe=696598&__pj0=0&__pj1=3ed8420c42c849845b5caa3de626e8fc).

In this project I've taken inspiration by Luigi Veronesi's abstract painting to randomly generate and animate artworks made of circles and lines.
